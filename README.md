# CSGOAutoCrouchShoot
AutoHotKey script that allows CSGO players to automatically crouch when shooting a gun for better accuracy.
Please DO NOT abuse this script in CSGO. You might / might not be banned

**LICENSE**<br/>
See LICENSE.txt for more details.

## Installation Instructions ##
1. Download & Install AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download the contents of this GitHub repo.
3. Right click on the CSGOAutoCrouchShoot.ahk file and choose the "Run Script" option to enable the cheat.

## Modification Instructions ##
If you want to only walk instead of crouch automatically when you shoot, change the words "Control" to "Shift" in the CSGOAutoCrouchShoot.ahk file. This will give you better accuracy than normal, but not as good as crouching. However, it will allow you to move faster than crouching while slower than normal. Basically, it is a middleground between crouching and running.

**SIDE EFFECT #1:** This program has the side effect of Control+Clicking whenever you left mosue click regardless of what program you are in when it is running. If you need to manage other programs, hold the control key on your keyboard. For a more permanent solution, you can either suspend hotkeys or stop the program from running entirely.

**SIDE EFFECT #2:** This program also has the side effect of making every gun in CSGO automatic. Whether this is good or bad is up to you. If you want to make every gun in CSGO automatic without all this AutoCrouchShoot stuff, see my other GitHub repo.
